== Overview

Kafkazavr is a real-time location-based service system implemented as two microservices (Driver and Rider) that communicate through Kafka messaging system. 
The system provides real-time location tracking and updates through a web interface.

== System Components

=== Microservices

==== Driver Service
* Role: Handles driver-side operations
* Implements: Location tracking and real-time updates
* Communication:
** Produces to: `driver` topic
** Consumes from: `rider` topic
* Endpoints:
** `/driver` - Web interface
** `/driver-ws` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates

==== Rider Service
* Role: Handles rider-side operations
* Implements: Location tracking and real-time updates
* Communication:
** Produces to: `rider` topic
** Consumes from: `driver` topic
* Endpoints:
** `/rider` - Web interface
** `/rider-ws` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates

=== Shared Components

==== Actor Pattern
Both services utilize a common actor pattern that provides:

* Kafka producer-consumer setup
* WebSocket handling
* Web interface integration
* MapBox integration for location visualization

==== Web Interface
* Interactive map using MapBox
* Real-time updates via WebSocket
* Vue.js for frontend interactivity
* Common styling and assets

=== Infrastructure

==== Apache Kafka
* Version: 3.9.0
* Configuration:
** KRaft mode (no ZooKeeper)
** Single node setup
** Internal port: 9092
** External port: 29092
* Topics:
** `driver` - For driver updates
** `rider` - For rider updates

== Technology Stack

=== Backend
* Kotlin
* Ktor framework
* Apache Kafka
* WebSocket

=== Frontend
* Vue.js
* MapBox GL JS
* MapBox Directions
* Turf.js for geospatial calculations
